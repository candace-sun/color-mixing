## Description
This is a personal project I'm currently working on to both learn React and try to design a visual and technical solution. The website currently allows users to select colors and view the results of mixing them. I hope to add features that show a mixing animation and a "reverse" that can output the exact colors and/or the ratio of colors needed to create a certain color. 

## Purpose
Inspired by my sister, an avid baker, this site is intended for use by creative professions that work with color in phyiscal mediums, such as painting or food decoration. It would allow users to see the results of mixing certain amounts of certain shades.
